Stacks
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.

Key points about stacks:

- Only the top element is accessible at any given time.
- Operations on a stack include push (add to top), pop (remove from top), peek (get top element), and isEmpty 
- Commonly used in scenarios where you need to maintain a history or undo functionality.

Examples of stack usage:

-Browser back button
-Undo actions in text editors
-Evaluating postfix expressions 


Queues

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed.

Key points about queues:

-Only the front element is accessible at any given time 
-Operations on a queue include enqueue (add to rear), dequeue (remove from front), peek (get front element), and isEmpty
-Used in scenarios where order matters and you want to process elements in the order they arrived 2

Examples of queue usage:

-Job scheduling systems
-Printer queues
-Message processing systems 

Key Differences

1. Access pattern: In a stack, only the top element is accessible. In a queue, only the front element is accessible.

2. Removal order: In a stack, the most recently added element is removed first. In a queue, the least recently added element is removed first.

3. Usage scenarios: Stacks are useful for maintaining a history or implementing undo functionality, while queues are ideal for managing ordered sequences of items.

4. Implementation: Stacks can be implemented using arrays or linked lists, while queues typically use arrays or circular buffers.

Best Practices

- Choose the appropriate data structure based on your specific requirements (LIFO vs FIFO)
- Implement proper error handling for full/empty conditions
- Consider the performance implications of choosing between array-based and linked-list implementations
- Be aware of the trade-offs between space complexity and time complexity for different implementations.

Understanding the differences between stacks and queues is crucial for effective data structure design and algorithm implementation in various programming contexts.
